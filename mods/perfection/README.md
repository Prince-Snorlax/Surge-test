Welcome to Perfection
----------------------------------------------------------------

- The goal of this project is to buff some underappreciated Pokemon.
- I, Insist, the founder of this project, would like to interact with the community in hopes of getting extra suggestions on how to modify something.

Concept
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- I would prefer we not buff stats directly, unless there is no other way to assist a Pokemon do better.
- The Fakemons project has merged into this project, so that will be fun.
- Consider this as a new region, things can get an evolution/pre-evolution.
- Learnsets can also be edited.
- New moves exist for this metagame.
- As well as a new typing __Cosmic__ exists.
